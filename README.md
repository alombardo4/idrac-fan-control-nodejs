# IDRAC Fan Control for NodeJS

This repository is designed to supercede my previous [idrac-fan-control-docker](https://github.com/alombardo4/idrac-fan-control-docker) repository, which wraps IPMITOOL with a number of shell scripts, and doesn't recover well on reboot, specifically when the filesystem persists.
